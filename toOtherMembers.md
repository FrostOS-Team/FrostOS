Hey guys,
I am proud, that you have invited me and I will help you when I have the time for that. But **what are the plans for FrostOS** and **what can I code for it?**

hope you answer under this

Well,
FrostOS is ment to be a graphical OS or if we want, a bash OS (like LMNet) and it's ment to be a community OS on the server.
Once finished, I'll post it to the CC Forums. You can code API's for the software and if you already have an API, you can have a go intergrating the API

P.S. The server has been down for the past week! I am concerned ;-;
