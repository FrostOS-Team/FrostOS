# My Plans for this OS
Because LMNet is a good Bash OS, I want an grapical os. I create the startup file and I plan to create a Launcher like the Ubuntus Unity.
I know that this isn't my os so if you don't like my Ideas you can write it here so I delete the files. 
I will use /Programs/<Name> to store Programs there, like OneOS. 
`Files inside:
	startup (the Code)
	data (using the AppData function)
	icon (yeah you know)
	...< Add your Ideas here>
	`
I also will create functions and tools so that you don't need much code for simple data. Like my AppData.load(). 
I also want to integrate much APIs of LMNet, because I domt want wo write them again. I will pull it from the LMNet Repo, so I hope it's ok!

I hope that my Code isn't a problem.
